# Ohio-Claims

Here is a shiny app I tried to make, and the eventual files I used, to create the graphics for a story about the frequency and successes of Court of Claims cases against Ohio University.

I used RShiny to create the app, and Plotly to host (they create the easiest tooltips).

You have the typical Shiny files, plus the files I did some data wrangling and plotly application in.

The story itself was written by Megan Henry for The Post in Athens, OH. I did the number-crunching.
